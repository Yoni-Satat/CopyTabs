## Created to copy all titles & urls from the 4th open tab in current window

In the past couple years I'm writing every week a news digest, basically copy/paste Titles & URLs who falls under certain topics (eg. Politics, Immigartion, Racism etc).

As you can probably imagine, most of the time is spent opening (lots of) tabs, navigating to each one twice, first to copy the title and paste it in a google document and the second time for the urlâ€¦ sounds tedious? Indeed it is!

Thankfully the folks at Google Chrome created this beautiful API that allows us to write an extension! Ahead I went and wa-lah! CopyTabs has been created!

### What does CopyTabs know to do:

* Copy from open tabs in current window:
    * Both Titles & URLs.
    * Just the URLs.
    * Just the Titles.

* Close each tab after it was copied
    * can be changed in Options page to leave copied tabs open

* Default settings:
    * Start copy from index 3 (the 4th open tab).
    * Close each copied tab.
